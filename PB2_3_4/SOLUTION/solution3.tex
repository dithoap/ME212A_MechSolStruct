\noindent \textbf{Question 1}: Write down the full problem! (kinematic, static and constitutive equations) \\

\noindent \textbf{Question 2}: We assume an Airy function $\phi(x,y) = ax^2 + cy^2 + h y^3$. Find $a$, $c$, $h$ so we define a statistically admissible stress field. \\

\noindent \textbf{Question 3}: Find the related strain field using the constitutive equation. Does that satisfy the compatibility equation? Conclusion? \\

\noindent \textbf{Question 4}: Integrate the strain field to get the displacement at every point. Can we find the exact solution of the problem using this Airy function?
